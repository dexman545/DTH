tech tree
	start with few options, then branch out, give players choices in what they can do (or at least indroduce them to a varaity of mods)
	start with TC
		tools will be TC, but more advanced tools should be better than TC tools, giving incentive to upgrade

remove reinforced iron smelting recipe
remove direct ore to ingot furnace recipes
